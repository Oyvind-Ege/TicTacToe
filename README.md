# Tic Tac Toe

This is my python implementation of Tic Tac Toe.

*From Wikipedia:*

Tic-tac-toe (American English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. 


### Todo

- [] Write draw() function for the Board class. This function will take data from self.game_board and render it nicely in the terminal.
- [] Handle user input. Allow user to select a number between 1 and 9. Insert a symbol at the corresponding coordinate.
- [] Write main loop.
